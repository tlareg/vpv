      <p>The term virtual patient is used to describe interactive computer simulations used in health care education.
        The special focus is targeted on the simulation of clinical processes with virtual patients.
        Virtual patients combine scientific excellence, modern technologies and the innovative concept of game-based learning.
        Virtual patients allow the learner to take the role of a health care professional and develop clinical skills such as making diagnoses and therapeutic decisions.
        Virtual patients have also been considered computer-based simulations designed to complement clinical training.
        The use of virtual patient programmes is increasing in healthcare,
        partly in response to increasing demands on health care professionals and education of students
        but also because they allow opportunity for students to practice in a safe environment.
        There are many different formats a virtual patient may take.
        However the overarching principle is that of interactivity
        - a virtual patient will have mechanisms for the learner to interact with the case and material or information is made available to the learner
        as they complete a range of learning activities. The interactivity is non-sequential.</p>
